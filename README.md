# OFT_UCI
UCI Center for Ambulatory Virtual Environment Research in Navigation/Neuroscience (CAVERN) Open Field Task for Desktop VR

This repository DOES NOT contain the full Unity files due to Unity not working well with GitHub. This does, however, contain custom scripts for logging data, trial structure, and necessary functionality for OFT to operate.

This repo also contains update logs on the overall completion of the OFT task in Unity, as well as a working OFT Output Data sheet that describes the data output from the task. If you require the most recent full version of the OFT task or have any questions, please contact the CAVERN Lab Manager, Rob, at rwoodry@uci.edu
